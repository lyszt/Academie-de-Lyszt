— **Qui aimes-tu le mieux, homme énigmatique, dis ? ton père, ta mère, ta sœur ou ton frère ?**  
— Je n’ai ni père, ni mère, ni sœur, ni frère.  
— **Tes amis ?**  
— Vous vous servez là d’une parole dont le sens m’est resté jusqu’à ce jour inconnu.  
— **Ta patrie ?**  
— J’ignore sous quelle latitude elle est située.  
— **La beauté ?**  
— Je l’aimerais volontiers, déesse et immortelle.  
— **L’or ?**  
— Je le hais comme vous haïssez Dieu.  
— **Eh ! qu’aimes-tu donc, extraordinaire étranger ?**  
— J’aime les nuages… les nuages qui passent… là-bas… là-bas… les merveilleux nuages !

Charles Baudelaire, Petits poèmes en prose, 1869

This section is dedicated to random programming experiments that probably don't make sense to anyone except me. Code that might solve problems, but also might summon Cthulhu.

| Scarlet Gateway II        | HTML + Javascript or HTML + Javascript & Frameworks | What if we recreated the Scarlett Gateway, but inside our portfolio website? Sadly of course, Github Pages doesn't allow for PHP and other back-end related services, so certain aspects are impossible. If we find another way, it might be more effective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Providence of Providentia | Python                                              | Remake Providentia, renew her code to be more class based and get some stuff inspired by Master Sara. Providentia Magnata should finally be build with its real purpose: Spy all servers she's in in discord, add it to a database and made data analysis of all members. Make defenses in our own server based on what she knows about people and make her dedicated to just one server: The empire of Lygon. In all others she's nothing but spyware. Automatically generate "reports" on users' activities. It can take innocent data points (like how often someone changes their profile picture or joins channels) and present them in a hyper-dramatic, dystopian way. Imagine it saying: "User 42 shows a 30% increase in anti-authoritarian sentiment. Consider re-education".  If you want to go full dystopia, the bot could have an interactive mode where it sends regular "announcements" like a telescreen. These could be unsettling reminders about compliance, loyalty, or surveillance (e.g., "Providentia is watching. Obey.").  Add a feature to manipulate server messages to reflect the regime's official stance, just like how history was rewritten in 1984. Have the bot edit or delete messages it deems “unacceptable” or replace certain keywords with approved phrases (e.g., "freedom" could be automatically changed to "obedience"). |
| Providentia MasterSuite   | Python + Web                                        | Providentia web interface to analyse members and get potential threats shown up in the screen as alerts. Possibility to make that into a responsive web app so I can access Providentia and control her from a distance. Build a sinister-looking dashboard that feels like it belongs in a dystopian regime. It could display user metrics like message frequency, who interacts with whom the most, key phrases, or behavior changes over time. Use data visualizations like heatmaps to show which channels are most "active" or to highlight potentially "rebellious" users (those who suddenly change chat patterns).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Lygon Phantasia           | Web App, uses tons of stuff                         | I really wanted to create a website just like Wattpad, Spirit Fanfics and Nyah Fanfiction, but with something plus. It's like a super cultural hub, and it hosts everything from video to literature. It's all art, art news and totally focused on aesthetics and the literate. Appeals to a variety of different interests and people, supports artists just like Twitter (X) and DeviantArt. Of course, the product might be developed slowly. We clearly don't have enough cloud space for streaming and video hosting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Crazy simulations!        | Mainly Python                                       | Recently I tried to simulate the lottery and found some really interesting stuff. I think I'll make a folder here and host some of these on Jupiter Notebooks. Some interesting ideas might be to simulate stuff like relationships, dive deeper into lottery, checking possibly how long one might take if several people are playing, and how many people we actually need to consistentely win in something under an hour. We could look into rating algorithms and other algorithms that are employed in other services in general regarding pretty much anything and everything and try to implement it in random tests to see what crazy stuff we can do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Lygon                     | No language or all languages, who knows?            | We have to develop further the idea of Lygon and what it may signify. He already have plenty of visual stuff worked on. We could make a corporate e-mail and start seeing how he can use affiliate's help to get clients in Freelance. I would like to think that Lygon might be a possible idea, but this requires further thinking, and we might as well do a freaking folder somewhere, or a repository on Github to work on everything we can involving Lygon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
